##Scope:
- Ability to store values in variables, an later retrieve or modify those values

##Program State:
- State of the variables

Where do those variables live and how the program find them

Well-defined set of rules for storing variables in some location, and for finding them later

##Compiler Theory:

- Javascript is an interpreted language (used to be)
  now its Just In Time (Compiled): Steps ->  Tokenizing / Lexing (word by word), Parsing (Sentences), Code-Generation (Generates machine code)

- Javascript engine is more complex than that

- Javascript code is copiled before executed.

- CODE
